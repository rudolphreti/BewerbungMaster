Three main services are needed: 
1. FileManagementService.cs - create folders with files related to job search
2. pdfGenerationService.cs - creating a cover letter from data.json
3. jsonService - CRUD operations on data.json

It would be useful to divide these services into folders, as each of them contains static and non-static methods.

pdfGenerationService.cs can be divided into static and non-static
